<h1>Why it's my favorite animal</h1>
<p>The reason why it's my favorite animal is that despite how tiny they are, mantis shrimp give my very strong punches, in fact they are said to give the strongest punch in the animal kingdom. It is said that Their club-like appendages accelerate faster than a bullet out of a gun, and just one strike can knock the arm off a crab or break through a snail shell. It's also believed to be strong enough to break a finger.</p>
